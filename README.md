# **MoodFood Frontend**

My application uses artificial intelligence to suggest recipes based on a user's current mood in order to enhance it.

---

## Motivation
Think of a time when someone asked what you wanted to eat. Usually our response is influenced by a current feeling we are trying to fulfill. As a nutrition science graduate, I'm always looking at the correlation between nutrients and psychology...or how specific nutrients affect how I feel. So I wanted to create an application that would give me food suggestions based on how I am currently feeling.

## Features

- Filter by diet preference
- Ingredient show page
